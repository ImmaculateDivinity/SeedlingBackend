# SeedlingEducation
This is an attempt at creating a web server project for the benefit of Modesto Junior College and the communities affected by it. It serves as a hub of information for those motivated enough to seek out opportunities beyond the immediate. It serves as a resource of education that enriches the classes and allows for those struggling to have tailored help. Through this project, the seedlings at this school hope to grow into towering trees.
